# Penetration Testing

## Objectives
- Understand the role of a penetration tester
- Learn how to identify and assess different attack vectors
- Understand some techniques used by penetration testers
- Practise/try some of the techniques used

## Programme

### What is penetration testing?

- enumeration: the process of gathering information about the target application, such as; the underlying server infrastructure, hidden files or directories or user credentials.

### Attack Vectors

#### Source Code Review
[EXERCISE:] [Web Applications: Page Source Review](https://immersivelabs.online/labs/web-applications-source-code-review/role/web-application-penetration-tester-beginner/series/web-app-hacking)

#### Sensitive Data Exposure

#### Command Injection/Execution

- What is it?
> The ability to send commands to a server and have them execute. This is usually done through forms on a webpage
